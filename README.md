Frenzyfetch is a fork of the famous Neofetch created by Dylan Araps. Just like the original fetch its in `bash 3.2+`. This fork aims for a smaller and simple information display just like pfetch, while also having just the necesary perks Neofetch contains.

Frenzyfetch is meant for eyecandy, that's it.

Not only you can get a display according to your distro, but also you can get some additional ascii pictures, located in the `dank` folder.

Furthermore, Frenzyfetch also aims for more customisability over the colorbars, where users could virtually add watever block style they can come up with (or steal lul).

Frenzyfetch also updates in par with Neofetch, because being deprecated is not cool at all
